# PAPB Installation

PAPB can be installed on two types of nodes. 

1. Gateway or Edge Node : A client node that does not do any cluster data processing or storage. Client nodes have BigData systems binaries installed in them for communication. If you have a client node in your cluster then it would be best to install PAPB on that. To install PAPB execute client.sh file in your terminal

$./create_client.sh
